# MongoDB Atlas Connection 

This repository demonstrates connecting a Go application to MongoDB Atlas using the Gin framework and MongoDB Go Driver.

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (1.22.6)
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account and cluster setup
- MongoDB Go Driver (`go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo`)

## Project Setup

### 1. Create a MongoDB Atlas Cluster

1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and log in.
2. Create a new project if you havenâ€™t already.
3. Set up a new **Cluster** in your project.
4. Configure network access to allow connections from your IP address.
5. Create a **Database User** with read and write permissions.

### 2. Get the MongoDB Connection URI

After setting up the cluster:

1. Go to **Database** in MongoDB Atlas and select **Connect** for your cluster.
2. Choose **Connect your application** and copy the **connection string** provided. It should look like this:


3. Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<database>` with your actual credentials and database name.

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
